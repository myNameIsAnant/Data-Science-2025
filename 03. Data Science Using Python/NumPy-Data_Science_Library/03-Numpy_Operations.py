## Operating on Multi Dimensional Array
marr = np.arange(0,25).reshape(5,5)
print("My MultiDimensional Array :",marr)
print("Sum of all elements of marr is :",marr.sum())
print("Sum of all elements across Rows of marr is :",marr.sum(axis=0))
print("Sum of all elements across Columns of marr is :",marr.sum(axis=1))
